Meanwhile, Peppermint Patty goes to the 'sleep disorders center' to find out why she's always nodding off in class; Charlie Brown becomes, in his worst baseball-related humiliation to date, the mascot of Peppermint Patty's 'Pelicans'; Linus finally gives up his security blanket once and for all; and Snoopy's brother Spike pops up in hilarious, deadpan vignettes set in far-flung Needles, California. The Complete Peanuts is the reprint project that launched a renaissance in comic strip publishing and the only place Charles M. Schulz's classic has ever been collected in its entirety.

Apple Valley, California, in the late eighties, a thirsty, miserable desert. Teenage James Spooner hates that he and his mom are back in town after years away. The one silver lining-new school, new you, right? But the few Black kids at school seem to be gangbanging, and the other kids fall on a spectrum of micro-aggressors to future Neo-Nazis. Mixed race, acutely aware of his Blackness, James doesn't know where he fits until he meets Ty, a young Black punk who introduces him to the school outsiders-skaters, unhappy young rebels, caught up in the punk groundswell sweeping the country. A haircut, a few Sex Pistols, Misfits and Black Flag records later: suddenly, James has friends, romantic prospects, and knows the difference between a bass and a guitar. But this desolate landscape hides brutal, building undercurrents: a classmate overdoses, a friend must prove himself to his white supremacist brother and the local Aryan brotherhood through a show of violence. Everything and everyone are set to collide at one of the year's biggest shows in town... Weaving in the Black roots of punk rock and a vivid interlude in the thriving eighties DIY and punk scene in New York's East Village, this is the memoir of a budding punk, artist, and activist.","PULL_COUNT":0,"SUB_COUNT":0,"TEST_PRODUCT":0,"DATE_ADDED":"2022-04-28 10:42:35","VARIANT":0,"VARIANT_RATIO":0,"LIMITED_VARIANT":0,"VARIANT_NOTES":"","NUMBER_OF_COVERS":1,"FCBD":"","HC":0,"TP":0,"GN":1,"DISPLAY_TITLE":"High Desert Black Punk Nowhere (GN)","IMAGE_URL_SMALL":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-sm.jpg","IMAGE_URL_SMALL_2x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-sm-2x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_SMALL_3x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-sm-3x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-md.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM_2x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-md-2x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM_3x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-md-3x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_ORIGINAL":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/40217-orig.jpg"},{"PS_NO":40006,"DIAMOND_NO":"MAR221433","LUNAR_NO":"","PRH_NO":"","MAIN_DESC":"HIT ME #3 (MR)","PAGE_COUNT":28,"WRITER":"Christa Faust","ARTIST":"Priscilla Petraites","COVER_ARTIST":"Jeff Dekal","STREET_DATE":"2022-05-18","FOC_DATE":"2022-04-25","MSRP":"3.990","DISCOUNT_CODE":"E","SERIES_CODE":"146539","ISSUE_NO":3,"COVER_NUMBER":0,"MAX_ISSUE":0,"PUBLISHER":"Awa Studios","CATEGORY":1,"MATURE":1,"ADULT":0,"ORDER_FORM_NOTES":"","PREVIEWS_PAGE":282,"UPC_NO":"85001385444800311","EAN_NO":"","PRODUCT_COPY":"A high-octane crime thriller from Christa Faust (Bad Mother, Redemption) and Priscilla Petraites (Chariot).

On September 11, 2001 a mysterious spacecraft of unknown origin dubbed 'WTF432' appeared in Earth's orbit and fired a beam of energy, striking the planet's surface. In the aftermath, dimensional fractures or 'rips' in space-time appeared throughout the world. These rips expel torrents of reality-distorting energy and are used by malevolent entities to travel between dimensions. The Terror Management Agency (TMA) was formed to track, investigate, and contain rip related phenomenon.  In this dimension, this was the defining moment of 2001 . . . the twin towers never fell.  Now, the long dormant WTF432 is active again, transmitting a signal to a remote town in California's Mojave Desert. The TMA sends bright and earnest Charley Gann and her razor-witted partner, Saoirse 'Free' Somerfield, to investigate. Eyewitnesses are reluctant to talk, local law is evasive, and the only evidence is a meandering trail of blackened footprints leading into the badlands . . . The In-Between follows our pair of reluctant heroines as every clue reveals another layer, exposing a cosmic struggle for control amongst a clandestine energy company, a doomsday cult, and the trans-dimensional entity they worship.

But she might just have the last laugh because the dime he accidentally sold her was his lucky Number One Dime - the first dime he ever earned! - and now she's about to melt it down for one of her strange spells! Then Uncle Scrooge gets wind of a big gold-prospecting contest in Alaska, and he ropes Donald and the boys into helping him prove he's just as good a prospector now as he was back when he was making his fortune. But the infuriatingly lucky Gladstone Gander decides he's going to enter the contest, too - and Gladstone never loses! And when a mysterious new planet suddenly appears in the sky on a collision course with Earth, Scrooge, Donald, and the boys are whisked there - only to discover it's filled with gold and inhabited by the ancient Norse gods! But to prevent the imminent collision, Scrooge must find a way to turn all that gold into iron - or both planets will be destroyed! Plus: the oddball inventions of the ever-eccentric Gyro Gearloose! Carl Barks delivers another wildly imaginative collection of outrageous adventures, laugh-out-loud comedy, and all-around comic book brilliance.

His enthusiasm gone, a desire to stop writing and put down the camera takes over. In the city for a year, he still wonders about how best to absorb the rich diversity of the cosmopolitan metropolis, settling on a simple idea: he will become a taxi driver.    Behind the iconic Yellow Cab, behind the fantasy of freedom and independence, behind the faces of his thousands of passengers, Benoît discovers a world to which he is a stranger. He dives into his new life with the idea of turning it into a screenplay for a future film, but the material he collects from this social experiment marks him deeply, leading down unsuspected paths: First, the administrative maze that leads to the taxi driver's license. Then the world behind the scenes. And finally, the prejudices that surround the profession and lead customers, cops, and the entire city to look at it-quite randomly-either with indifference, kindness, or aggression. The project transforms into an autobiographical novel interspersed with reflections on the creative process, and with the help of Chabouté, it is now a sensitive, deeply human graphic novel with breathtaking illustrations that pay vibrant tribute to New York City.","PULL_COUNT":0,"SUB_COUNT":0,"TEST_PRODUCT":0,"DATE_ADDED":"2022-03-05 11:21:09","VARIANT":0,"VARIANT_RATIO":0,"LIMITED_VARIANT":0,"VARIANT_NOTES":"","NUMBER_OF_COVERS":1,"FCBD":"","HC":0,"TP":0,"GN":1,"DISPLAY_TITLE":"Yellow Cab (GN)","IMAGE_URL_SMALL":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-sm.jpg","IMAGE_URL_SMALL_2x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-sm-2x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_SMALL_3x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-sm-3x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-md.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM_2x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-md-2x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_MEDIUM_3x":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-md-3x.jpg","IMAGE_URL_ORIGINAL":"https://pullscription-product-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/34888-orig.jpg"},{"PS_NO":40422,"DIAMOND_NO":"MAR222068","LUNAR_NO":"","PRH_NO":"","MAIN_DESC":"ZOM 100 BUCKET LIST OF THE DEAD GN VOL 06 (C: 0-1-2)","PAGE_COUNT":160,"WRITER":"Haro Aso","ARTIST":"Kotaro Takata","COVER_ARTIST":"","STREET_DATE":"2022-05-18","FOC_DATE":"0000-00-00","MSRP":"12.990","DISCOUNT_CODE":"E","SERIES_CODE":"144593","ISSUE_NO":6,"COVER_NUMBER":0,"MAX_ISSUE":0,"PUBLISHER":"VIZ LCC","CATEGORY":3,"MATURE":0,"ADULT":0,"ORDER_FORM_NOTES":"","PREVIEWS_PAGE":426,"UPC_NO":"","EAN_NO":"978197472451251299","PRODUCT_COPY":"Akira has returned home to his parents' village to repay his folks for all they've done for him.
